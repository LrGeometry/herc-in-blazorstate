### Contributing	

HERC protocol is an open source and community based project to which the core development team highly encourages fellow developers to build improvements and scale the future of the platform.  
To report bugs within the HERC smart contracts or unit tests, please create an issue in this repository. 

## HIPS
Parlimentary or Significant changes to HERC protocol's smart contracts, architecture, message format or functionality should be proposed in the 
[HERC Improvement Proposals (HIPS)](https://github.com/hercone/hips) repository. Follow the contribution guidelines provided therein :) 

### Coding Conventions
As we have found from other projects such as 0x and other Ethereum based platforms we use a custom set of [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) rules to enforce our coding conventions. 

In order to see style violation erros, install a tsliner for your text editor. e.g Atom's [atom-typescript](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript) -->
