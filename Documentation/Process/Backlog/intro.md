# The Backlog

This is a text based system.  
For more sophisticated tools use VSTS.

All hierarchy of the process is just a folder.
If you need to group something for clarity add a folder.

## New Items

We want to capture ideas and we want that to be real simple.
Just create a file in the `New` folder or add to an existing one.  
Capture as much detail as you like.

As we progress we can determine file naming conventions.
To start give it a Short title.

## Ready Items

This folder will contain the Items we think are Ready to be worked on.
In either a single md file with checklists or multiple files.

## Iteration Items

This will be the items we are working on in this iteration/Sprint.
We will use a checklist in md somewhere to easily see what is done.
Do we really need to track in progress?  
If so we will adjust the process when needed.
