Last couple of days have been doing much css styling and slacked on my dev notebook.

- [x] add favicon.  
     There is more to this than meets the eye.  Need to test on many platforms and seleinum can't test it.
     using the basic for now.
     ```html
     <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.ico">
     ```
- [] Remove diagnostic colors from Header.
