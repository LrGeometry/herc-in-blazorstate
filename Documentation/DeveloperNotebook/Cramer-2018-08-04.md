I tried to figure out how to manually create the App Registration in Azure.
Gave up and the script version was all I could get to work.

- [x] Configure Service Endpoint in VSTS to point to newly create Azure Endpoint

Set up a very basic CD for HercPwa
I thought yaml in the build was supposed to be out 
but couldn't see any indication.

- [x] Configure Continuous Deployment for App
