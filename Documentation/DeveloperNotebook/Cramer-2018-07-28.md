# Developer Notebook
This is a folder containing daily notes related to this repository.
The file format should be `<DeveloperName>-yyyy-MM-dd.md`
The Notes are far from formal.  The key benefit is to help the developer
remember what they were doing when they come back to the repository at a later time.

Secondary benefit, but not required, is to have a dialog that corresponds to each commit.

> Sometimes you may actually update the notes. So the story won't be in sync.
> Or your notes may not be in the order you actually commit the code.

# VSTS or GitHub for my repository?

The top objective of the day is to get source pushed to the cloud and have CI/CD configured in VSTS.
First we need to determine where the repository will go VSTS or GitHub?

If we go straight to github then all is public even if we are not ready for review or
assistance.  If we go VSTS then eventually we need to move to github.
I am assuming Microsoft is going to make the moving between VSTS and Github easy.
They are just git repositories, so not that hard today.

Lets start with VSTS today as I don't want public review just yet.
