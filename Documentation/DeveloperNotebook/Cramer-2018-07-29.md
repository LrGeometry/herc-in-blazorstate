# Continous Integration

We now have a DocFX static site being generated
as well as the base Blazor template site.

The concept behind Agile/Scrum is to ship a product on an iterative basis.  
At the end of each sprint we want to be able to deploy the latest version of product.
Given this objective it stands to reason that confguring the tooling used to build and deploy be done in the first sprint.

We are using VSTS and it recently made yaml generally available for the CI pipelines.
The VSTS team in their last sprint also made yaml for CD available as a preview.
We will be using both.

## Create initial yaml 
In order to have a yaml build set up in VSTS you have to have a yaml file.  The [convention for VSTS yaml file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/pipelines/build/yaml?view=vsts#automatically-create-a-yaml-build-pipeline) is to name it `.vsts-ci.yml`

Add .vsts-ci.yml
```yaml
steps:
- script: echo hello world 
```
- [x] Create initial yaml
